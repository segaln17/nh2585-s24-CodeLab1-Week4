# ANT-SMASHING 2: THE RETURN

Now with high scores!

NOTE: the high score table saves to a file, but the file did not generate unless initial values were added to the list in the script (they could be commented out later). From there, the high scores now don't save properly; the latest score gotten is saved, but the rest of the table populates automatically in a very strange way and I don't know why. I tested this in the class code from last Tuesday as well, and the same problem existed there, so I'm not currently sure how to solve this bug.
